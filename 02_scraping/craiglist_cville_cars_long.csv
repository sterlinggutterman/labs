A few changes have been made but it's largely the vehicle that was built on the show - still has the Hemi V8 and 4 spd Atlas.  It now sits on 39.5's, it's been boat-sided and the cage is different.  Recently the D44s were removed and a pair of one tons (D60/Sterling) out of a Super Duty were trussed and swapped in to better match the rest of the Jeep.  The interior of the axles are in good shape as the covers have been removed, inspected and filled with fresh gear oil.  The front axle is open and the rear is a limited-slip, so they just need lockers, depending on your usage.  It's been barely used over the last 10 or so years that I've owned it and it's too nice to just let sit.  I started to convert it to more of a street legal vehicle a while back (and was going to run some smaller tires on narrower axles) so the flares were added - they need to be removed or trimmed for the 39's.  Fires right up and sounds great.Drivetrain:- Low mileage '05 5.7L Hemi and attached automatic trans (545RFE) with Lokar shifter, 4 speed Atlas transfer case, Super Duty axles (leaf spring era - confirmed a D60 not a D50).

Must see this super rare Mopar Stepside loaded with fac-tree options.......Air Conditioning, Power Steering, Power Brakes, Automatic, Radio, Vanity mirror, coat hook, and twin sun visors.......this is Mopar Heaven!   The mileage is ultra low at only 68,000 original miles.  This gem sat in a warehouse for many years, and thus this original paint still shows well, with a little patina to boot.  A close look inside the fender wells, the cab corners, and along the frame will show a rust-free body and frame. The original factory wooden bed has been removed, and beautiful solid cherry boards were used to replace them.  Before installing the cherry boards, the frame was cleaned and painted to ensure an eternal life.  (I have many more pics of this restoration for anyone who wants to see more details).  When you take this rig to the classic car/truck shows, be sure to have paper towels handy, as there will be alot of drooling going on when the Mopar Knucklheads see this fine cherry bed.  The ""426 Hemi"" emblems mixed with a rare 8-foot stepside with a cherry bed.........everyone will be rejoicing at this eye candy, and will surely think that they are in Heaven.  Perhaps some exaggeration, but it does indeed have a very nice cherry bed.  Comes with four 1972 Corvette hubcaps, and two of the original Dodge dog-dish hubcaps.  Is that an insult to Dodge or Corvettes....you can decide......but they look pretty good on the old truck.I will confess and admit that there is one modification from the factory specs that I performed, just to get people's reaction, and it was an inexpensive method of boosting the horse-power (at least in my imagination).  I did add the ""426"" emblems on the fenders, and air cleaner........this truck sports the original 318, which still has plenty of get-up and go.  The original factory primer and paint is still present on the inner fenders, and the exterior paint is original and is proud to display some of the scratches and nicks earned over the past 50 years.  The engine hood has the most paint wear and patina as a result of a prior owner attempting to buff-out the paint, and they were a bit too aggressive.  Fortunately they stopped and did not attempt to buff anymore of the original paint.  The hood could sometime be re-painted or left to preserve the derelict nature of these old Mopar classic trucks.  The original paint is still in great shape in the rear inner fenders.....amazing for a 50 year old Dodge truck.  Starts right up and drives very nice down the highway......power steering is smooth, no vibrations or odd noises.  Plenty of power, and the transmission shifts smoothly like a new one (these TorqueFlights or PowerFlights were built strong and made to last).  The transmission fluid is clean and at the full level when checked with engine at operating temp.  Idles great and without any exhaust leaks. All lights, turn signals, horn, etc. work.Engine initially smoked some due to the Marvel Mystery Oil which I soaked all cylinders with as I was restoring the wooden bed and doing other mechanical work.  That has burned  through the system with some road driving, and it no longer smokes.Maintenance:* Oil and filter recently changed, and 1 qt Marvel Mystery Oil added*  Radiator drained/flushed and new antifreeze added last fall*  New front brake calipers and pads*  Master brake cylinder drained and fresh fluid to all four brakes*  Transmission fluid is clean*   Great compression in all cylinders, about 140psi*  Great Oil Pressure:  65psi at idle at start-up, after warmed up: 40psi at 2000rpm and 25psi at idle*  All new ignition/electronic components*  Exhaust system is in great shape*  Cleaned and repacked front wheel bearings, all in perfect condition*  Removed and cleaned the factory plastic gas tank.  Was in perfect condition, along with fuel gauge sending unit and fuel screen inside tank. One small crack at the top was repaired with multiple layers of fiberglass and resin, and re-installed with rubber on mounting straps to reduce vibration on tank.*  Differential fluid was full and clean*  Air conditioning needs to be recharged/checked for possible leaks*  The heater core hoses have been disconnected due to a possible leak at the heater core hose connection, or a leak in the heater core.*  New wiper motor and wiper drive-linkage bushings.  Cowl gutter is in perfect condition....none of the typical rust.*  Wiring harness connection at fire-wall was inspected and cleaned, and the connectors were in perfect condition, no corrosion, and no sign of heat damage.  I installed another heavy duty wire (shunt wire) from the alternator to the battery which will help ensure that excessive amps do not pass through the firewall connections on its way to the dash volt meter.  An adjustable voltage regulator is on order as the current one is allowing 15.5 volts to the battery which is about a volt too high."
